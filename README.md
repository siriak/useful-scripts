# Useful Scripts

This repo contains most of the scripts I use to automate routine tasks.

startup - run at startup. When reinstalling OS, it's handy to add all to the startup at once.

start-working - starts all work-related stuff.

update-repos - pulls latest changes for all repositories when the system reboots.

Submodules are described in their repositories.
